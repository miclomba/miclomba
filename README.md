## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

azulejo-* repos are distributed under the MIT license. Here you will find various projects ranging from MIPS CPU, graphics pipeline, file system, video games, kernel extensions (coming soon), app libraries, and more.

## About me

I'm on a relentless quest to learn.

### Design
I try to bring a good sense of design and craftsmanship these repos. With that in mind, you can find some of my creative work at my [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/miklumba/).
