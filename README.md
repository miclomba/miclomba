## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my Github! 

## About me

Computers are my playground. Building, hacking, and learning what happens under the hood (through the Kernel and down to the hardware) is what I live for. This is important for me as I take nothing for granted. Back in College, I once enrolled in a Real Analysis course so that I could learn how Calculus was dervied ðŸ¤¯! This curiosity has been a defining characteristic in my career and has created many opportunities for me to explore different aspects of the software development sector.

### Design, Media --> Craftsmanship
Making great art and media requires good craftsmanship and a good sense of design. For this reason, I leave you with some artifacts of my creative work (which you can find on my [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/miklumba/).

### HPC for AI, Physical Sciences, and Climate
Huge science nerd over here ðŸ™‚. Having a MS in Geophysics (i.e. Earth Physics + Geology) and minor in Mathematics, I've been fortunate to get to play with the HPC of some of the coolest optimization, simulation, and modeling problems in AI, robotics, energy, physics, and climate.
