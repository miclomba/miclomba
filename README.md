## About me

Computers are my playground. Building, hacking, and learning what happens under the hood (through the Kernel and down to the hardware) is what I live for. This is important for me as I take nothing for granted. Back in College, I once enrolled in a Real Analysis course so that I could learn how Calculus was dervied ðŸ¤¯! This curiosity has been a defining characteristic in my career and has created many opportunities for me to explore different aspects of the software development sector (in AI, robotics, energy, physics, and climate).
